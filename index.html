          Comparative Religion -- Dr. Zakir Naik's Key Focus
        </h3>
        <p>
          <span>Comparative religion</span> is a field of study that examines the similarities and differences between the world's major religions. Dr. Naik specialized in this area, particularly focusing on the common principles between <span>Islam</span>, <span>Christianity</span>, <span>Hinduism</span>, <span>Judaism</span>, and other faiths. His approach involved quoting scriptures from the <span>Bible</span>, the <span>Bhagavad Gita</span>, the <span>Torah</span>, and the <span>Qur'an</span> to highlight shared values, ethical guidelines, and spiritual teachings. He often stressed that while the specifics of religious practice may differ, the core messages of faiths often align around concepts like monotheism, morality, and justice.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Dr. Naik</span>'s goal with comparative religion was to foster greater understanding and reduce misunderstandings between followers of different religions. He believed that by focusing on common ground, interfaith harmony could be achieved, and people of different beliefs could coexist peacefully.
